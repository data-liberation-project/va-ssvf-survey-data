## Code

This repository currently contains two pieces of Python code:

- [`scripts/extract-pdf-tables.py`](scripts/extract-pdf-tables.py), which extracts the provider satisfaction table that spans on pages 21–25 of [`pdfs/VA SSVF Year End Report FY20.pdf`](pdfs/VA%20SSVF%20Year%20End%20Report%20FY20.pdf), and saves that data to [`data/from-pdfs/provider-satisfaction-fy20.csv`](data/from-pdfs/provider-satisfaction-fy20.csv). In the future, this script might be expanded to extract additional tables, and from additional PDFs.
- [`notebooks/satisfaction-calculations.ipynb`](notebooks/satisfaction-calculations.ipynb), which checks that the raw survey data matches (in at least the tested aspects) with the results presented in the PDF table noted above, and generates [`data/output/provider-satisfaction-by-fiscal-year.csv`](data/output/provider-satisfaction-by-fiscal-year.csv)

## Output

The [notebook mentioned above](notebooks/satisfaction-calculations.ipynb) generates [`data/output/provider-satisfaction-by-fiscal-year.csv`](data/output/provider-satisfaction-by-fiscal-year.csv), which calculates the total number of responses to the SSVF survey's question on general satisfaction, overall and by response (Extremely Poor, Below Average, Average, Above Average, Excellent), by provider and fiscal year.
